In recent years, most mobile game developers focus on free-to-play (F2P) games. However, it is extremely difficult for F2P games to define whether players are churning, which makes game operators hard to retain players. In addition, new players have a higher churn rate. Therefore, if operators can accurately predict the new players that may churn, they can immediately adopt a retention strategy to lost players, looking forward that this will increase the retention rate of new players and thus effectively increase revenue.

This thesis proposes a machine learning framework for this topic, which is composed of five major stages: (1) pre-processing stage, (2) analysis stage, (3) machine learning stage, (4) feature extraction analysis stage and (5) businese application analysis stage. To be specific, the framework will need to process the data and data analysis before prediction, and train the model via machine learning algorithm, then analyze important features with the prediction results. Finally, by using surrogate model, the framework will be able to find out the patterns of player churn.
